## Game description
First, the program chose a random word you need to guess.

It will print "_" for each letter in that word.

Then you can write any letter a-z or A-Z.

At the start, you have a total of 9 lives.

When you enter a letter that is not in the chosen word, you lose 1 life.
If you guess correctly all the containing letters before you lose all of your lives, you won the game.
